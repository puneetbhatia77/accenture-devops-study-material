1. Create a directory “<yourname>-gitrepo” (e.g. “puneet-gitrepo” for me) at your local machine.
2. Create 3 files (with “.c”, ".sh" and ".java" extensions. 
3. Commit to master branch and your username and email id should be reflected while committing the files.
4. Create a new repository at gibhub an push the files.
